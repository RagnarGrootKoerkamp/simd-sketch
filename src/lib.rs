//! # SimdSketch
//!
//! This library provides two types of sequence sketches:
//! - the classic bottom-`s` sketch;
//! - the newer bucket sketch, returning the smallest hash in each of `s` buckets.
//!
//! See the corresponding [blogpost](https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/simd-sketch/) for more background and an evaluation.
//!
//! ## Hash function
//! All internal hashes are 32 bits. Either a forward-only hash or
//! reverse-complement-aware (canonical) hash can be used.
//!
//! **TODO:** Current we use (canonical) ntHash. This causes some hash-collisions
//! for `k <= 16`, [which could be avoided](https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/nthash/#is-nthash-injective-on-kmers).
//!
//! ## BucketSketch
//! For classic bottom-sketch, evaluating the similarity is slow because a
//! merge-sort must be done between the two lists.
//!
//! The bucket sketch solves this by partitioning the hashes into `s` partitions.
//! Previous methods partition into ranges of size `u32::MAX/s`, but here we
//! partition by remainder mod `s` instead.
//!
//! We find the smallest hash for each remainder as the sketch.
//! To compute the similarity, we can simply use the hamming distance between
//! two sketches, which is significantly faster.
//!
//! The bucket sketch similarity has a very strong one-to-one correlation with the classic bottom-sketch.
//!
//! **TODO:** A drawback of this method is that some buckets may remain empty
//! when the input sequences are not long enough.  In that case, _densification_
//! could be applied, but this is not currently implemented. If you need this, please reach out.
//! Instead, we currently simply keep a bitvector indicating empty buckets.
//!
//! ## Jaccard similarity
//! For the bottom sketch, we conceptually estimate similarity as follows:
//! 1. Find the smallest `s` distinct k-mer hashes in the union of two sketches.
//! 2. Return the fraction of these k-mers that occurs in both sketches.
//!
//! For the bucket sketch, we simply return the fraction of parts that have
//! the same k-mer for both sequences (out of those that are not both empty).
//!
//! ## b-bit sketches
//!
//! Instead of storing the full 32-bit hashes, it is sufficient to only store the low bits of each hash.
//! In practice, `b=8` is usually fine.
//! When extra fast comparisons are needed, use `b=1` in combination with a 3 to 4x larger `s`.
//!
//! This causes around `1/2^b` matches because of collisions in the lower bits.
//! We correct for this via `j = (j0 - 1/2^b) / (1 - 1/2^b)`.
//! When the fraction of matches is less than `1/2^b`, this is negative, which we explicitly correct to `0`.
//!
//! ## Mash distance
//! We compute the mash distance as `-log( 2*j / (1+j) ) / k`.
//! This is always >=0, but can be as large as `inf` when `j=0` (as is the case for disjoint input sets).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The main entrypoint of this library is the [`Sketcher`] object.
//! Construct it in either the forward or canonical variant, and give `k` and `s`.
//! Then call either [`Sketcher::bottom_sketch`] or [`Sketcher::sketch`] on it, and use the
//! `similarity` functions on the returned [`BottomSketch`] and [`BucketSketch`] objects.
//!
//! ```
//! use packed_seq::SeqVec;
//!
//! let sketcher = simd_sketch::SketchParams {
//!     alg: simd_sketch::SketchAlg::Bucket,
//!     rc: false,  // Set to `true` for a canonical (reverse-complement-aware) hash.
//!     k: 31,      // Hash 31-mers
//!     s: 8192,    // Sample 8192 hashes
//!     b: 8,       // Store the bottom 8 bits of each hash.
//!     filter_empty: true, // Explicitly filter out empty buckets for BucketSketch.
//! }.build();
//!
//! // Generate two random sequences of 2M characters.
//! let n = 2_000_000;
//! let seq1 = packed_seq::PackedSeqVec::random(n);
//! let seq2 = packed_seq::PackedSeqVec::random(n);
//!
//! // Sketch using given algorithm:
//! let sketch1: simd_sketch::Sketch = sketcher.sketch(seq1.as_slice());
//! let sketch2: simd_sketch::Sketch = sketcher.sketch(seq2.as_slice());
//!
//! // Value between 0 and 1, estimating the fraction of shared k-mers.
//! let j = sketch1.jaccard_similarity(&sketch2);
//! assert!(0.0 <= j && j <= 1.0);
//!
//! let d = sketch1.mash_distance(&sketch2);
//! assert!(0.0 <= d);
//! ```
//!
//! **TODO:** Currently there is no support yet for merging sketches, or for
//! sketching multiple sequences into one sketch. It's not hard, I just need to find a good API.
//! Please reach out if you're interested in this.
//!
//! **TODO:** If you would like a binary instead of a library, again, please reach out :)
//!
//! ## Implementation notes
//!
//! This library works by partitioning the input sequence into 8 chunks,
//! and processing those in parallel using SIMD.
//! This is based on the [`packed-seq`](../packed_seq/index.html) and [`simd-minimizers`](../simd_minimizers/index.html) crates.
//!
//! For bottom sketch, the largest hash should be around `target = u32::MAX * s / n` (ignoring duplicates).
//! To ensure a branch-free algorithm, we first collect all hashes up to `bound = 1.5 * target`.
//! Then we sort the collected hashes. If there are at least `s` left after deduplicating, we return the bottom `s`.
//! Otherwise, we double the `1.5` multiplication factor and retry. This
//! factor is cached to make the sketching of multiple genomes more efficient.
//!
//! For bucket sketch, we use the same approach, and increase the factor until we find a k-mer hash in every bucket.
//! In expectation, this needs to collect a fraction around `log(n) * s / n` of hashes, rather than `s / n`.
//! In practice this doesn't matter much, as the hashing of all input k-mers is the bottleneck,
//! and the sorting of the small sample of k-mers is relatively fast.
//!
//! For bucket sketch we assign each element to its bucket via its remainder modulo `s`.
//! We compute this efficiently using [fast-mod](https://github.com/lemire/fastmod/blob/master/include/fastmod.h).
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! The sketching throughput of this library is around 2 seconds for a 3GB human genome
//! (once the scaling factor is large enough to avoid a second pass).
//! That's typically a few times faster than parsing a Fasta file.
//!
//! [BinDash](https://github.com/zhaoxiaofei/bindash) instead takes 180s (90x
//! more), when running on a single thread.
//!
//! Comparing sketches is relatively fast, but can become a bottleneck when there are many input sequences,
//! since the number of comparisons grows quadratically. In this case, prefer bucket sketch.
//! As an example, when sketching 5MB bacterial genomes using `s=10000`, each sketch takes 4ms.
//! Comparing two sketches takes 1.6us.
//! This starts to be the dominant factor when the number of input sequences is more than 5000.
